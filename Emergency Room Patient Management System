Emergency Room Patient Management System

Scenario:

You are tasked with designing a system for managing patients in a hospital's Emergency Room (ER). In the ER, patients are not treated in the order they arrive, but rather based on the severity of their conditionâ€”more critical patients are treated first. In case multiple patients have the same severity, the one who arrived first should be treated first.

Requirements:

1. Design classes to represent:

    A `Patient` with attributes: `name`, `age`, `condition`, `severity` (an integer from 1 to 10, where 10 is most severe), and `arrivalTime`.
    A `HospitalER` system that supports the following operations:

      `addPatient(Patient patient)`: Add a new patient to the ER queue.
      `treatNextPatient()`: Return and remove the next patient to be treated.
      `peekNextPatient()`: Return (but do not remove) the next patient to be treated.

2. The system should ensure that:

    Patients with higher severity are treated first.
    If two patients have the same severity, the one who arrived earlier is treated first.
