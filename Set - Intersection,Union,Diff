You are helping organize a coding bootcamp. Two workshops are being offered: Data Science and Web Development. The students have registered for these workshops as follows:
Data Science workshop attendees:
data_science = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Ethan"}
Web Development workshop attendees:
web_dev = {"Charlie", "Fiona", "George", "Alice", "Hannah"}
You have been asked to perform the following tasks using Python:
Find the list of students who are attending both workshops.
Find the list of students who are attending at least one of the two workshops.
Find the students who are attending only the Web Development workshop.
Output : 
Students attending both workshops: {'Alice', 'Charlie'}
Students attending at least one workshop: {'Ethan', 'Diana', 'Charlie', 'Fiona', 'Alice', 'George', 'Bob', 'Hannah'}
Students attending only the Web Development workshop: {'Fiona', 'George', 'Hannah'}
